# sideways - Privacy policy 
### Location
sideways is a navigation app, and as such it will use the location of the user. However, this location only exits the user's phone when using the search functionality, to give relevant results near him. This location is never stored and this can be avoided by disabling location before searching. 

### User data
sideways will store the email address and Google account ID(Primary account) of users to keep track of the amount of route requests they have left and if they have purchased the premium version with unlimited route requests. This information is uploaded to our servers but it's not shared with any third party.

### Crash reports
When the app crashes, the information about the problem is anonymously sent to the app servers for later analysis. This includes the logs of the crash and basic phone information like the model and Android version, but it does't contain any account/identification data.

### Data deletion
If any user wishes to delete their data, the app doesn't provide a direct way of doing it but they can contact me at the email address below and I will have no problem deleting it.

### Contact
For any questions about the app and its data treatment I'm available at my email address
